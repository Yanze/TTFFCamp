        "description": "sometimes a small bush, sometimes a small tree. Buckeye blooms appear in 4 to 12 inch plumes at the tips of the branches in spring to early summer. Their colors range from the white of horse chestnut, bottlebrush and California buckeye blooms, to the yellow of Ohio buckeye, to the hummingbird-attracting scarlet of red buckeye. Its leaves bud in late winter/early spring and fall off midsummer, taking advantage of the coolest, wettest part of the season (smartest tree in CA).",
